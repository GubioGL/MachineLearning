#  Welcome to my codenotes for machine learning!

This repository is dedicated to my trajectory in the area of Classical Machine Learning.

I like studyng with online couse, i think this hel a lote whend you need a diretion in you study or whend you is a begining
I like studying online, I think it helps a lot when you need guidance in your studies or when you're starting out. These are the main sources I used: 

* #1 - Starting from data analysis ([IBM course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python)).

  This course covers everything from the fundamentals of data analysis with Python to the creation and evaluation of data models.
  
  Detailed details include:
  - data collection and import
  - cleaning, preparing and formatting data
  - manipulation of data frames
  - data summary
  - creating machine learning regression models
  - model refinement
  - creating data pipelines.

  You will learn how to import data from multiple sources, clean and organize data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and create meaningful data visualizations.
  You will then predict future trends from the data, developing linear, multiple, and polynomial regression models and pipelines, and learn how to evaluate them.



* #2 - Going through a basic and general study of ML (IBM course).

* #3 - And finally, delving deeper into neural networks through a "Lecture Series" given by Prof. Dr. Florian Marquardt.
